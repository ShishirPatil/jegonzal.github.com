   abstract     = {We propose opportunistic evaluation, a framework for accelerating interactions with dataframes. Interactive latency is critical for iterative, human-in-the-loop dataframe workloads for supporting exploratory data analysis. Opportunistic evaluation significantly reduces interactive latency by 1) prioritizing computation directly relevant to the interactions and 2) leveraging think time for asynchronous background computation for non-critical operators that might be relevant to future interactions. We show, through empirical analysis, that current user behavior presents ample opportunities for optimization, and the solutions we propose effectively harness such opportunities.}

In response, previous work combines decision trees with deep learning, yielding models that (1) sacrifice interpretability for accuracy or (2) sacrifice accuracy for interpretability. We forgo this dilemma by jointly improving accuracy and interpretability using Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs). NBDTs replace a neural network's final linear layer with a differentiable sequence of decisions and a surrogate loss. This forces the model to learn high-level concepts and lessens reliance on highly-uncertain decisions, yielding (1) accuracy: NBDTs match or outperform modern neural networks on CIFAR, ImageNet and better generalize to unseen classes by up to 16\%. Furthermore, our surrogate loss improves the original model's accuracy by up to 2\%. NBDTs also afford (2) interpretability: improving human trustby clearly identifying model mistakes and assisting in dataset debugging.},

      High-performance tensor programs are crucial to guarantee efficient execution of deep neural networks. However, obtaining performant tensor programs for different operators on various hardware platforms is notoriously challenging. Currently, deep learning systems rely on vendor-provided kernel libraries or various search strategies to get performant tensor programs. These approaches either require significant engineering effort to develop platform-specific optimization code or fall short of finding high-performance programs due to restricted search space and ineffective exploration strategy.

      We present Ansor, a tensor program generation framework for deep learning applications. Compared with existing search strategies, Ansor explores many more optimization combinations by sampling programs from a hierarchical representation of the search space. Ansor then fine-tunes the sampled programs with evolutionary search and a learned cost model to identify the best programs. Ansor can find high-performance programs that are outside the search space of existing state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, Ansor utilizes a task scheduler to simultaneously optimize multiple subgraphs in deep neural networks. We show that Ansor improves the execution performance of deep neural networks relative to the state-of-the-art on the Intel CPU, ARM CPU, and NVIDIA GPU by up to 3.8x, 2.6x, and 1.7x, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of the boundary thickness of a classifier, and we describe its connection with and usefulness for model robustness. Thick decision boundaries lead to improved performance, while thin decision boundaries lead to overfitting (e.g., measured by the robust generalization gap between training and testing) and lower robustness. We show that a thicker boundary helps improve robustness against adversarial examples (e.g., improving the robust test accuracy of adversarial training), as well as so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) transforms, and we show that many commonly-used regularization and data augmentation procedures can increase boundary thickness. On the theoretical side, we establish that maximizing boundary thickness is akin to minimizing the so-called mixup loss. Using these observations, we can show that noise-augmentation on mixup training further increases boundary thickness, thereby combating vulnerability to various forms of adversarial attacks and OOD transforms. We can also show that the performance improvement in several recent lines of work happens in conjunction with a thicker boundary.}

One major challenge with FQT is the lack of theoretical understanding, in particular of how gradient quantization impacts convergence properties. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a statistical framework for analyzing FQT algorithms. We view the quantized gradient of FQT as a stochastic estimator of its full precision counterpart, a procedure known as quantization-aware training (QAT). We show that the FQT gradient is an unbiased estimator of the QAT gradient, and we discuss the impact of gradient quantization on its variance. Inspired by these theoretical results, we develop two novel gradient quantizers, and we show that these have smaller variance than the existing per-tensor quantizer. For training ResNet-50 on ImageNet, our 5-bit block Householder quantizer achieves only 0.5\% validation accuracy loss relative to QAT, comparable to the existing INT8 baseline.}

Such cross-camera analytics is data and compute intensive, whose costs grow with the number of cameras and time. We present Spatula, a cost-efficient system that enables scaling cross-camera analytics on edge compute boxes to large camera networks by leveraging the spatial and temporal cross-camera correlations. While such correlations have been used in computer vision community, Spatula uses them to drastically reduce the communication and computation costs by pruning search space of a query identity (e.g., ignoring frames not correlated with the query identity's current position). Spatula provides the first system substrate on which cross-camera analytics applications can be built to efficiently harness the cross-camera correlations that are abundant in large camera deployments. Spatula reduces compute load by 8.3x on an 8-camera dataset, and by 23x-86x on two datasets with hundreds of cameras (simulated from real vehicle/pedestrian traces). We have also implemented Spatula on a testbed of 5 AWS DeepLens cameras.}

   abstract     = {Robotic manipulation of deformable 1D objects such as ropes, cables, and hoses is challenging due to the lack of high-fidelity analytic models and large configuration spaces. Furthermore, learning end-to-end manipulation policies directly from images and physical interaction requires significant time on a robot and can fail to generalize across tasks. We address these challenges using interpretable deep visual representations for rope, extending recent work on dense object descriptors for robot manipulation. This facilitates the design of interpretable and transferable geometric policies built on top of the learned representations, decoupling visual reasoning and control. We present an approach that learns point-pair correspondences between initial and goal rope configurations, which implicitly encodes geometric structure, entirely in simulation from synthetic depth images. We demonstrate that the learned representation - dense depth object descriptors (DDODs) - can be used to manipulate a real rope into a variety of different arrangements either by learning from demonstrations or using interpretable geometric policies. In 50 trials of a knot-tying task with the ABB YuMi Robot, the system achieves a 66\% knot-tying success rate from previously unseen configurations.}

To adaptively provide such computation, we propose Fog Robotics algorithms in which cloud-based serverless lambda computing provides parallel computation on demand. To use this parallelism, we propose novel motion planning algorithms that scale effectively with an increasing number of serverless computers. However, given that the allocation of computing is typically bounded by both monetary and time constraints, we show how prior learning can be used to efficiently allocate resources at runtime. We demonstrate the algorithms and application of learned parallel allocation in both simulation and with the Fetch commercial mobile manipulator using Amazon Lambda to complete a sequence of sporadically computationally intensive motion planning tasks.}

      Serverless computing is a new paradigm that promises to free cloud users from the burden of having to provision and manage resources. However, the degree to which serverless computing will replace provisioned servers remains an open question.

      To address this, we develop an economic model that aims to quantify the value of serverless to providers and customers. A simple model of incentives for rational providers and customers allows us to see, in broad strokes, when and why serverless technologies are worth pursuing. By characterizing the conditions under which mutually beneficial economic incentives exist, our model suggests that many classes of customers can already benefit from switching to a serverless model and taking advantage of autoscaling at today's price points. Our model also helps characterize technical research directions that would be likely to have impact in the market.

Virtualizing deployment of deep learning models can facilitate large-scale use/re-use of off-the-shelf functional behaviors. Deploying deep learning models on robots entails real-time, accurate and reliable inference service under varying query load. This letter introduces a novel Robot-Inference-and-Learning-as-a-Service (RILaaS) platform for low-latency and secure inference serving of deep models that can be deployed on robots. Unique features of RILaaS include: 1) low-latency and reliable serving with gRPC under dynamic loads by distributing queries over multiple servers on Edge and Cloud, 2) SSH based authentication coupled with SSL/TLS based encryption for security and privacy of the data, and 3) front-end REST API for sharing, monitoring and visualizing performance metrics of the available models. We report experiments to evaluate the RILaaS platform under varying loads of batch size, number of robots, and various model placement hosts on Cloud, Edge, and Fog for providing benchmark applications of object recognition and grasp planning as a service. We address the complexity of load balancing with a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes simulated profiles of networked robots; outperforming several baselines including round robin, least connections, and least model time with 68.30\% and 14.04\% decrease in round-trip latency time across models compared to the worst and the next best baseline respectively.

This is motivated by applications in cloud markets and online advertising where an agent may know her value for an allocation only after experiencing it. Therefore, the mechanism needs to explore different allocations for each agent, while simultaneously attempting to find the socially optimal set of allocations. Our focus is on truthful and individually rational mechanisms which imitate the classical VCG mechanism in the long run. To that end, we define three notions of regret for the welfare, the individual utilities of each agent and that of the mechanism. We show that these three terms are interdependent via an \$\Omega(T^{2/3})\$ lower bound for the maximum of these three terms after T rounds of allocations, and describe a family of anytime algorithms which achieve this rate. Our framework provides flexibility to control the pricing scheme so as to trade-off between the agent and seller regrets, and additionally to control the degree of truthfulness and individual rationality.}

We present the design and implementation of Cloudburst, a stateful FaaS platform that provides familiar Python programming with low-latency mutable state and communication, while maintaining the autoscaling benefits of serverless computing. Cloudburst accomplishes this by leveraging Anna, an autoscaling key-value store, for state sharing and overlay routing combined with mutable caches co-located with function executors for data locality. Performant cache consistency emerges as a key challenge in this architecture. To this end, Cloudburst provides a combination of lattice-encapsulated state and new definitions and protocols for distributed session consistency. Empirical results on benchmarks and diverse applications show that Cloudburst makes stateful functions practical, reducing the state-management overheads of current FaaS platforms by orders of magnitude while also improving the state of the art in serverless consistency.}

In this work, we propose a task-aware feature generation (TFG) framework for compositional learning, which generates features of novel visual concepts by transferring knowledge from previously seen concepts. These synthetic features are then used to train a classifier to recognize novel concepts in a zero-shot manner. Our novel TFG design injects task-conditioned noise layer-by-layer, producing task-relevant variation at each level. We find the proposed generator design improves classification accuracy and sample efficiency. Our model establishes a new state of the art on three zero-shot compositional learning (ZSCL) benchmarks, outperforming the previous discriminative models by a large margin. Our model improves the performance of the prior arts by over 2x in the generalized ZSCL setting.}

However, prior analysis of LMPC controllers for stochastic systems has mainly focused on linear systems in the iterative learning control setting. We present a novel LMPC algorithm, Adjustable Boundary Condition LMPC (ABC-LMPC), which enables rapid adaptation to novel start and goal configurations and theoretically show that the resulting controller guarantees iterative improvement in expectation for stochastic nonlinear systems. We present results with a practical instantiation of this algorithm and experimentally demonstrate that the resulting controller adapts to a variety of initial and terminal conditions on 3 stochastic continuous control tasks.}

   abstract     = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) yields state-of-the-art neural networks that outperform their best manually-designed counterparts. However, previous NAS methods search for architectures under one training recipe (i.e., training hyperparameters), ignoring the significance of training recipes and overlooking superior architectures under other training recipes. Thus, they fail to find higher-accuracy architecture-recipe combinations. To address this oversight, we present JointNAS to search both (a) architectures and (b) their corresponding training recipes. To accomplish this, we introduce a neural acquisition function that scores architectures and training recipes jointly. Following pre-training on a proxy dataset, this acquisition function guides both coarse-grained and fine-grained searches to produce FBNetV3. FBNetV3 is a family of state-of-the-art compact ImageNet models, outperforming both automatically and manually-designed architectures. For example, FBNetV3 matches both EfficientNet and ResNeSt accuracy with 1.4x and 5.0x fewer FLOPs, respectively. Furthermore, the JointNAS-searched training recipe yields significant performance gains across different networks and tasks.}

However, DARTS-based DNAS's search space is small when compared to other search methods', since all candidate network layers must be explicitly instantiated in memory. To address this bottleneck, we propose a memory and computationally efficient DNAS variant: DMaskingNAS. This algorithm expands the search space by up to \$10^{14}\times\$ over conventional DNAS, supporting searches over spatial and channel dimensions that are otherwise prohibitively expensive: input resolution and number of filters. We propose a masking mechanism for feature map reuse, so that memory and computational costs stay nearly constant as the search space expands. Furthermore, we employ effective shape propagation to maximize per-FLOP or per-parameter accuracy. The searched FBNetV2s yield state-of-the-art performance when compared with all previous architectures. With up to 421x less search cost, DMaskingNAS finds models with 0.9\% higher accuracy, 15\% fewer FLOPs than MobileNetV3-Small; and with similar accuracy but 20\% fewer FLOPs than Efficient-B0. Furthermore, our FBNetV2 outperforms MobileNetV3 by 2.6\% in accuracy, with equivalent model size. FBNetV2 models are open-sourced at https://github.com/facebookresearch/mobile-vision.}

Such a simple approach outperforms the meta-learning methods by roughly 2\~20 points on current benchmarks and sometimes even doubles the accuracy of the prior methods. However, the high variance in the few samples often leads to the unreliability of existing benchmarks. We revise the evaluation protocols by sampling multiple groups of training examples to obtain stable comparisons and build new benchmarks based on three datasets: PASCAL VOC, COCO and LVIS.

In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm, called FetchSGD, to overcome these challenges. FetchSGD compresses model updates using a Count Sketch, and then takes advantage of the mergeability of sketches to combine model updates from many workers. A key insight in the design of FetchSGD is that, because the Count Sketch is linear, momentum and error accumulation can both be carried out within the sketch. This allows the algorithm to move momentum and error accumulation from clients to the central aggregator, overcoming the challenges of sparse client participation while still achieving high compression rates and good convergence. We prove that FetchSGD has favorable convergence guarantees, and we demonstrate its empirical effectiveness by training two residual networks and a transformer model.}

      Since hardware resources are limited, the objective of training deep learning models is typically to maximize accuracy subject to the time and memory constraints of training and inference. We study the impact of model size in this setting, focusing on Transformer models for NLP tasks that are limited by compute: self-supervised pretraining and high-resource machine translation. We first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per iteration, wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps. Moreover, this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore, the most compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely large models but stop after a small number of iterations.

      This leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models. However, we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques such as quantization and pruning than small models. Consequently, one can get the best of both worlds: heavily compressed, large models achieve higher accuracy than lightly compressed, small models.

      Prior research in resource scheduling for machine learning training workloads has largely focused on minimizing job completion times. Commonly, these model training workloads collectively search over a large number of parameter values that control the learning process in a hyperparameter search. It is preferable to identify and maximally provision the best-performing hyperparameter configuration (trial) to achieve the highest accuracy result as soon as possible.

      To optimally trade-off evaluating multiple configurations and training the most promising ones by a fixed deadline, we design and build HyperSched---a dynamic application-level resource scheduler to track, identify, and preferentially allocate resources to the best performing trials to maximize accuracy by the deadline. HyperSched leverages three properties of a hyperparameter search workload overlooked in prior work -- trial disposability, progressively identifiable rankings among different configurations, and space-time constraints -- to outperform standard hyperparameter search algorithms across a variety of benchmarks.

With pandas as a reference, we propose a simple data model and algebra for dataframes to ground discussion in the field. Given this foundation, we lay out an agenda of open research opportunities where the distinct features of dataframes will require extending the state of the art in many dimensions of data management. We discuss the implications of signature data-frame features including flexible schemas, ordering, row/column equivalence, and data/metadata fluidity, as well as the piecemeal, trial-and-error-based approach to interacting with dataframes.}

      Coopetitive analytics refers to cooperation among competing parties to run queries over their joint data. Regulatory, business, and liability concerns prevent these organizations from sharing their sensitive data in plaintext.

      We propose Oblivious Coopetitive Queries (OCQ), an efficient, general framework for oblivious coopetitive analytics using hardware enclaves. OCQ builds on Opaque, a Spark-based framework for secure distributed analytics, to execute coopetitive queries using hardware enclaves in a decentralized manner. Its query planner chooses how and where to execute each relational operator to prevent data leakage through side channels such as memory access patterns, network traffic statistics, and cardinality, while minimizing overhead.

      We implemented OCQ as an extension to Apache Spark SQL. We find that OCQ is up to 9.9x faster than Opaque, a state-of-the-art secure analytics framework which outsources all data and computation to an enclave-enabled cloud; and is up to 219x faster than implementing analytics using AgMPC, a state-of-the-art secure multi-party computation framework.

      Serverless computing has grown in popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of applications being built on Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms. By default, FaaS platforms support retry-based fault tolerance, but this is insufficient for programs that modify shared state, as they can unwittingly persist partial sets of updates in case of failures. To address this challenge, we would like atomic visibility of the updates made by a FaaS application.

      In this paper, we present aft, an atomic fault tolerance shim for serverless applications. aft interposes between a commodity FaaS platform and storage engine and ensures atomic visibility of updates by enforcing the read atomic isolation guarantee. aft supports new protocols to guarantee read atomic isolation in the serverless setting. We demonstrate that aft introduces minimal overhead relative to existing storage engines and scales smoothly to thousands of requests per second, while preventing a significant number of consistency anomalies.

In this work, we build a hybrid neural-network and decision-tree model for segmentation that (1) attains neural network segmentation accuracy and (2) provides semi-automatically constructed visual decision rules such as ''Is there a window?.'' We obtain semantic visual meaning by extending saliency methods to segmentation and attain accuracy by leveraging insights from neural-backed decision trees, a deep learning analog of decision trees for image classification. Our model SegNBDT attains accuracy within ~2-4\% of the state-of-the-art HRNetV2 segmentation model while also retaining explainability; we achieve state-of-the-art performance for explainable models on three benchmark datasets -- Pascal-Context (49.12\%), Cityscapes (79.01\%), and Look Into Person (51.64\%).

   abstract = {In modern Machine Learning, model training is an iterative, experimental process that can consume enormous computation resources and developer time. To aid in that process, experienced model developers log and visualize program variables during training runs. Exhaustive logging of all variables is infeasible, so developers are left to choose between slowing down training via extensive conservative logging, or letting training run fast via minimalist optimistic logging that may omit key information. As a compromise, optimistic logging can be accompanied by program checkpoints; this allows developers to add log statements post-hoc, and "replay" desired log statements from checkpoint---a process we refer to as hindsight logging. Unfortunately, hindsight logging raises tricky problems in data management and software engineering. Done poorly, hindsight logging can waste resources and generate technical debt embodied in multiple variants of training code. In this paper, we present methodologies for efficient and effective logging practices for model training, with a focus on techniques for hindsight logging. Our goal is for experienced model developers to learn and adopt these practices. To make this easier, we provide an open-source suite of tools for Fast Low-Overhead Recovery (flor) that embodies our design across three tasks: (i) efficient background logging in Python, (ii) adaptive periodic checkpointing, and (iii) an instrumentation library that codifies hindsight logging for efficient and automatic record-replay of model-training. Model developers can use each flor tool separately as they see fit, or they can use flor in hands-free mode, entrusting it to instrument their code end-to-end for efficient record-replay. Our solutions leverage techniques from physiological transaction logs and recovery in database systems. Evaluations on modern ML benchmarks demonstrate that flor can produce fast checkpointing with small user-specifiable overheads (e.g. 7\%), and still provide hindsight log replay times orders of magnitude faster than restarting training from scratch.},

In this work, we focus on bird's eye semantic segmentation, a task that predicts pixel-wise semantic segmentation in BEV from side RGB images. This task is made possible by simulators such as Carla, which allow for cheap data collection, arbitrary camera placements, and supervision in ways otherwise not possible in the real world. There are two main challenges to this task: the view transformation from side view to bird's eye view, as well as transfer learning to unseen domains. Existing work transforms between views through fully connected layers and transfer learns via GANs. This suffers from a lack of depth reasoning and performance degradation across domains. Our novel 2-staged perception pipeline explicitly predicts pixel depths and combines them with pixel semantics in an efficient manner, allowing the model to leverage depth information to infer objects' spatial locations in the BEV. In addition, we transfer learning by abstracting high-level geometric features and predicting an intermediate representation that is common across different domains. We publish a new dataset called BEVSEG-Carla and show that our approach improves state-of-the-art by 24\% mIoU and performs well when transferred to a new domain.}

Our approach uses no human-provided labels, relying only on the raw text of programs. In particular, we design an unsupervised pretext task by generating textually divergent copies of source functions via automated source-to-source compiler transforms that preserve semantics. We train a neural model to identify variants of an anchor program within a large batch of negatives. To solve this task, the network must extract program features representing the functionality, not form, of the program. This is the first application of instance discrimination to code representation learning to our knowledge. We pre-train models over 1.8m unannotated JavaScript methods mined from GitHub. ContraCode pre-training improves code summarization accuracy by 7.9\% over supervised approaches and 4.8\% over RoBERTa pre-training. Moreover, our approach is agnostic to model architecture; for a type inference task, contrastive pre-training consistently improves the accuracy of existing baselines.}

However, finite-time analysis of constrained TS is challenging; as a result, only O( sqrt( T ) ) bounds on the cumulative reward loss (i.e., the regret) are available. In this paper, we describe LinConTS, a TS-based algorithm for bandits that place a linear constraint on the probability of earning a reward in every round. We show that for LinConTS, the regret as well as the cumulative constraint violations are upper bounded by O( log ( T ) ). We develop a proof technique that relies on careful analysis of the dual problem and combine it with recent theoretical work on unconstrained TS. Through numerical experiments on two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LinConTS outperforms an asymptotically optimal upper confidence bound (UCB) scheme in terms of simultaneously minimizing the regret and the violation.}

   abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics is challenging due to the difficulty in hand-engineering a dense cost function, which can lead to unintended behavior, and dynamical uncertainty, which makes exploration and constraint satisfaction challenging. We address these issues with a new model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, Safety Augmented Value Estimation from Demonstrations (SAVED), which uses supervision that only identifies task completion and a modest set of suboptimal demonstrations to constrain exploration and learn efficiently while handling complex constraints. We then compare SAVED with 3 state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms on 6 standard simulation benchmarks involving navigation and manipulation and a physical knot-tying task on the da Vinci surgical robot. Results suggest that SAVED outperforms prior methods in terms of success rate, constraint satisfaction, and sample efficiency, making it feasible to safely learn a control policy directly on a real robot in less than an hour. For tasks on the robot, baselines succeed less than 5\% of the time while SAVED has a success rate of over 75\% in the first 50 training iterations. Code and supplementary material is available}

Prior work explores dropping activations as a strategy to scale to larger neural networks with fixed memory. However, these heuristics assume uniform cost per layer and only consider simple linear chain architectures, limiting their usability. In this paper, we formalize the problem of trading-off computation time and memory requirements for DNN training as the tensor rematerialization optimization problem. We develop a new system to optimally solve the problem in reasonable times (under an hour) using off-the-shelf MILP solvers. These schedules subsequently accelerate millions of training iterations. Our optimization pass in TensorFlow 2.0 automatically yields real training speedups of up to 4.8x over prior work, and can enable up to 5x increase in input size for real-world large networks.}

However, there are many settings where the supervisor may evolve during policy learning, such as a human performing a novel task or an improving algorithmic controller. We formalize imitation learning from a ``converging supervisor'' and provide sublinear static and dynamic regret guarantees against the best policy in hindsight with labels from the converged supervisor, even when labels during learning are only from intermediate supervisors. We then show that this framework is closely connected to a class of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms known as dual policy iteration (DPI), which alternate between training a reactive learner with imitation learning and a model-based supervisor with data from the learner. Experiments suggest that when this framework is applied with the state-of-the-art deep model-based RL algorithm PETS as an improving supervisor, it outperforms deep RL baselines on continuous control tasks and provides up to an 80-fold speedup in policy evaluation.}

   abstract     = {Deep neural networks exhibit exceptional accuracy when they are trained and tested on the same data distributions. However, neural classifiers are often extremely brittle when confronted with domain shift---changes in the input distribution that occur over time. We present ACE, a framework for semantic segmentation that dynamically adapts to changing environments over the time. By aligning the distribution of labeled training data from the original source domain with the distribution of incoming data in a shifted domain, ACE synthesizes labeled training data for environments as it sees them. This stylized data is then used to update a segmentation model so that it performs well in new environments. To avoid forgetting knowledge from past environments, we introduce a memory that stores feature statistics from previously seen domains. These statistics can be used to replay images in any of the previously observed domains, thus preventing catastrophic forgetting. In addition to standard batch training using stochastic gradient decent (SGD), we also experiment with fast adaptation methods based on adaptive meta-learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets from SYNTHIA, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach when adapting to a number of tasks.}

   abstract     = {Cellular networks dynamically adjust the transmission parameters for a wireless link in response to its time-varying channel state. This is known as link adaptation, where the typical goal is to maximize the link throughput. State-of-the-art outer loop link adaptation (OLLA) selects the optimal transmission parameters based on an approximate, offline, model of the wireless link. Further, OLLA refines the offline model by dynamically compensating any deviations from the observed link performance. However, in practice, OLLA suffers from slow convergence and a sub-optimal link throughput. In this paper, we propose a link adaptation approach that overcomes the shortcomings of OLLA through a novel learning scheme. Our approach relies on contextual multi-armed bandits (MAB), where the context vector is composed of the instantaneous wireless channel state along with side information about the link. For a given context, our approach learns the success probability for each of the available transmission parameters, which is then exploited to select the throughput-maximizing parameters. Through numerical experiments, we show that our approach converges faster than OLLA and achieves a higher steady-state link throughput. For frequent and infrequent channel reports respectively, our scheme outperforms OLLA by 15\% and 25\% in terms of the steady-state link throughput.}

The Neural ODE method introduced earlier is in fact a special case of this new more general framework. We present the formulation of ANODEV2, derive optimality conditions, and implement a coupled reaction-diffusion-advection version of this framework in PyTorch. We present empirical results using several different configurations of ANODEV2, testing them on multiple models on CIFAR-10. We report results showing that this coupled ODE-based framework is indeed trainable, and that it achieves higher accuracy, as compared to the baseline models as well as the recently-proposed Neural ODE approach.}

As a consequence, in settings where training data is limited (e.g., few-shot and zero-shot learning), we are typically forced to use a generic feature embedding across various tasks. Ideally, we want to construct feature embeddings that are tuned for the given task. In this work, we propose Task-Aware Feature Embedding Networks (TAFE-Nets) to learn how to adapt the image representation to a new task in a meta learning fashion. Our network is composed of a meta learner and a prediction network. Based on a task input, the meta learner generates parameters for the feature layers in the prediction network so that the feature embedding can be accurately adjusted for that task. We show that TAFE-Net is highly effective in generalizing to new tasks or concepts and evaluate the TAFE-Net on a range of benchmarks in zero-shot and few-shot learning. Our model matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art on all tasks. In particular, our approach improves the prediction accuracy of unseen attribute-object pairs by 4 to 15 points on the challenging visual attribute-object composition task.}

Sparsifying such networks has been an active area of research but has been generally limited to static regularization or dynamic approaches using reinforcement learning. We explore a mixture of experts (MoE) approach to deep dynamic routing, which activates certain experts in the network on a per-example basis. Our novel DeepMoE architecture increases the representational power of standard convolutional networks by adaptively sparsifying and recalibrating channel-wise features in each convolutional layer. We employ a multi-headed sparse gating network to determine the selection and scaling of channels for each input, leveraging exponential combinations of experts within a single convolutional network. Our proposed architecture is evaluated on four benchmark datasets and tasks, and we show that Deep-MoEs are able to achieve higher accuracy with lower computation than standard convolutional networks.}

In this paper, we present a `Fog Robotics' approach to deep robot learning that distributes compute, storage and networking resources between the Cloud and the Edge in a federated manner. Deep models are trained on non-private (public) synthetic images in the Cloud; the models are adapted to the private real images of the environment at the Edge within a trusted network and subsequently, deployed as a service for low-latency and secure inference/prediction for other robots in the network. We apply this approach to surface decluttering, where a mobile robot picks and sorts objects from a cluttered floor by learning a deep object recognition and a grasp planning model. Experiments suggest that Fog Robotics can improve performance by sim-to-real domain adaptation in comparison to exclusively using Cloud or Edge resources, while reducing the inference cycle time by 4\times to successfully declutter 86\% of objects over 213 attempts.}

The modularity of the update branch, where feature subnetworks of varying layer depth can be inserted (e.g. ResNet-18 to ResNet-101), enables operation over a new, state-of-the-art accuracy-throughput trade-off spectrum. Over this curve, Accel models achieve both higher accuracy and faster inference times than the closest comparable single-frame segmentation networks. In general, Accel significantly outperforms previous work on efficient semantic video segmentation, correcting warping-related error that compounds on datasets with complex dynamics. Accel is end-to-end trainable and highly modular: the reference network, the optical flow network, and the update network can each be selected independently, depending on application requirements, and then jointly fine-tuned. The result is a robust, general system for fast, high-accuracy semantic segmentation on video.}

We investigate these issues, with an emphasis on time to convergence and total computational cost, through an extensive empirical analysis of network training across several architectures and problem domains, including image classification, image segmentation, and language modeling. Although it is common practice to increase the batch size in order to fully exploit available computational resources, we find a substantially more nuanced picture. Our main finding is that across a wide range of network architectures and problem domains, increasing the batch size beyond a certain point yields no decrease in wall-clock time to convergence for \emph{either} train or test loss. This batch size is usually substantially below the capacity of current systems. We show that popular training strategies for large batch size optimization begin to fail before we can populate all available compute resources, and we show that the point at which these methods break down depends more on attributes like model architecture and data complexity than it does directly on the size of the dataset.}

Scaling video analytics to massive camera deployments, however, presents a new and mounting challenge, as compute cost grows proportionally to the number of camera feeds. This paper is driven by a simple question: can we scale video analytics in such a way that cost grows sublinearly, or even remains constant, as we deploy more cameras, while inference accuracy remains stable, or even improves. We believe the answer is yes. Our key observation is that video feeds from wide-area camera deployments demonstrate significant content correlations (e.g. to other geographically proximate feeds), both in space and over time. These spatio-temporal correlations can be harnessed to dramatically reduce the size of the inference search space, decreasing both workload and false positive rates in multi-camera video analytics. By discussing use-cases and technical challenges, we propose a roadmap for scaling video analytics to large camera networks, and outline a plan for its realization.}

      The dominant cost in production machine learning workloads is not training individual models but serving predictions from increasingly complex prediction pipelines spanning multiple models, machine learning frameworks, and parallel hardware accelerators. Due to the complex interaction between model configurations and parallel hardware, prediction pipelines are challenging to provision and costly to execute when serving interactive latency-sensitive applications. This challenge is exacerbated by the unpredictable dynamics of bursty workloads.

      In this paper we introduce InferLine, a system which efficiently provisions and executes ML inference pipelines subject to end-to-end latency constraints by proactively optimizing and reactively controlling per-model configuration in a fine-grained fashion. Unpredictable changes in the serving workload are dynamically and cost-optimally accommodated with minimal service level degradation. InferLine introduces (1) automated model profiling and pipeline lineage extraction, (2) a fine-grain, cost-minimizing pipeline configuration planner, and (3) a fine-grain reactive controller. InferLine is able to configure and deploy prediction pipelines across a wide range of workload patterns and latency goals. It outperforms coarse-grained configuration alternatives by up 7.6x in cost while achieving up to 32x lower SLO miss rate on real workloads and generalizes across state-of-the-art model serving frameworks.

Since many clinically important classes can occur in low frequencies, approaches are needed to improve performance on rare classes. We compare the performance of several single-class classifiers on rare classes to a multi-headed classifier across all available classes. We demonstrate that the addition of common classes can significantly improve CNN performance on rarer classes when compared to a model trained on the rarer class in isolation. Using this method, we develop a model with high performance as measured by F1 score on multiple clinically relevant classes compared against the gold-standard cardiologist interpretation.}

   abstract     = {Large-scale labeled training datasets have enabled deep neural networks to excel on a wide range of benchmark vision tasks. However, in many applications it is prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to obtain large quantities of labeled data. To cope with limited labeled training data, many have attempted to directly apply models trained on a large-scale labeled source domain to another sparsely labeled target domain. Unfortunately, direct transfer across domains often performs poorly due to domain shift and dataset bias. Domain adaptation is the machine learning paradigm that aims to learn a model from a source domain that can perform well on a different (but related) target domain. In this paper, we summarize and compare the latest unsupervised domain adaptation methods in computer vision applications. We classify the non-deep approaches into sample re-weighting and intermediate subspace transformation categories, while the deep strategy includes discrepancy-based methods, adversarial generative models, adversarial discriminative models and reconstruction-based methods. We also discuss some potential directions.}

The spatial similarity of nearby video frames, however, suggests opportunity to reuse computation. Existing work has explored basic feature reuse and feature warping based on optical flow, but has encountered limits to the speedup attainable with these techniques. In this paper, we present a new, two part approach to accelerating inference on video. First, we propose a fast feature propagation technique that utilizes the block motion vectors present in compressed video (e.g. H.264 codecs) to cheaply propagate features from frame to frame. Second, we develop a novel feature estimation scheme, termed feature interpolation, that fuses features propagated from enclosing keyframes to render accurate feature estimates, even at sparse keyframe frequencies. We evaluate our system on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, comparing to both a frame-by-frame baseline and related work. We find that we are able to substantially accelerate segmentation on video, achieving near real-time frame rates (20.1 frames per second) on large images (960 x 720 pixels), while maintaining competitive accuracy. This represents an improvement of almost 6x over the single-frame baseline and 2.5x over the fastest prior work.}

We demonstrate the implementation of several state-of-the-art hyperparameter search algorithms in Tune.}

We formulate the dynamic skipping problem in the context of sequential decision making and propose a hybrid learning algorithm that combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to address the challenges of non-differentiable skipping decisions. We show SkipNet reduces computation by 30-90\% while preserving the accuracy of the original model on four benchmark datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art dynamic networks and static compression methods. We also qualitatively evaluate the gating policy to reveal a relationship between image scale and saliency and the number of layers skipped.}

We introduce the ``I Don't Know''(IDK) prediction cascades framework, a general framework to systematically compose a set of pre-trained models to accelerate inference without a loss in prediction accuracy. We propose two search based methods for constructing cascades as well as a new cost-aware objective within this framework. The proposed IDK cascade framework can be easily adopted in the existing model serving systems without additional model re-training.

We fuse shifts and point-wise convolutions to construct end-to-end trainable shift-based modules, with a hyperparameter characterizing the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. To demonstrate the operation's efficacy, we replace ResNet's 3x3 convolutions with shift-based modules for improved CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 accuracy using 60\% fewer parameters; we additionally demonstrate the operation's resilience to parameter reduction on ImageNet, outperforming ResNet family members. We finally show the shift operation's applicability across domains, achieving strong performance with fewer parameters on classification, face verification and style transfer.}

      With the increasing commoditization of computer vision, speech recognition and machine translation systems and the widespread deployment of learning-based back-end technologies such as digital advertising and intelligent infrastructures, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has moved from research labs to production. These changes have been made possible by unprecedented levels of data and computation, by methodological advances in machine learning, by innovations in systems software and architectures, and by the broad accessibility of these technologies.

      The next generation of AI systems promises to accelerate these developments and increasingly impact our lives via frequent interactions and making (often mission-critical) decisions on our behalf, often in highly personalized contexts. Realizing this promise, however, raises daunting challenges. In particular, we need AI systems that make timely and safe decisions in unpredictable environments, that are robust against sophisticated adversaries, and that can process ever increasing amounts of data across organizations and individuals without compromising confidentiality. These challenges will be exacerbated by the end of the Moore's Law, which will constrain the amount of data these technologies can store and process. In this paper, we propose several open research directions in systems, architectures, and security that can address these challenges and help unlock AI's potential to improve lives and society.

We explore how Deep Neural Networks can represent meta-policies that switch among a set of previously learned policies, specifically in settings where the dynamics of a new scenario are composed of a mixture of previously learned dynamics and where the state observation is possibly corrupted by sensing noise. We also report the results of experiments varying dynamics mixes, distractor policies, magnitudes/distributions of sensing noise, and obstacles. In a fully observed experiment, the meta-policy learning algorithm achieves 2.6x the reward achieved by the next best policy composition technique with 80\% less exploration.

PARIS is able to predict workload performance for different user-specified metrics, and resulting costs for a wide range of VM types and workloads across multiple cloud providers. When compared to sophisticated baselines, including collaborative filtering and a linear interpolation model using measured workload performance on two VM types, PARIS produces significantly better estimates of performance.

      Machine learning is being deployed in a growing number of applications which demand real-time, accurate, and robust predictions under heavy query load. However, most machine learning frameworks and systems only address model training and not deployment.

      In this paper, we introduce Clipper, a general-purpose low-latency prediction serving system. Interposing between end-user applications and a wide range of machine learning frameworks, Clipper introduces a modular architecture to simplify model deployment across frameworks and applications. Furthermore, by introducing caching, batching, and adaptive model selection techniques, Clipper reduces prediction latency and improves prediction throughput, accuracy, and robustness without modifying the underlying machine learning frameworks. We evaluate Clipper on four common machine learning benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to meet the latency, accuracy, and throughput demands of online serving applications. Finally, we compare Clipper to the Tensorflow Serving system and demonstrate that we are able to achieve comparable throughput and latency while enabling model composition and online learning to improve accuracy and render more robust predictions.

We view this ``optimistic concurrency control'' paradigm as particularly appropriate for large-scale machine learning algorithms, particularly in the unsupervised setting. We demonstrate our approach in three problem areas: clustering, feature learning and online facility location. We evaluate our methods via large-scale experiments in a cluster computing environment.}

      From social networks to targeted advertising, big graphs capture the structure in data and are central to recent advances in machine learning and data mining. Unfortunately, directly applying existing data-parallel tools to graph computation tasks can be cumbersome and inefficient. The need for intuitive, scalable tools for graph computation has lead to the development of new graph-parallel systems (e.g., Pregel, PowerGraph) which are designed to efficiently execute graph algorithms. Unfortunately, these new graph-parallel systems do not address the challenges of graph construction and transformation which are often just as problematic as the subsequent computation. Furthermore, existing graph-parallel systems provide limited fault-tolerance and support for interactive data mining.

      We introduce GraphX, which combines the advantages of both data-parallel and graph-parallel systems by efficiently expressing graph computation within the Spark data-parallel framework. We leverage new ideas in distributed graph representation to efficiently distribute graphs as tabular data-structures. Similarly, we leverage advances in data-flow systems to exploit in-memory computation and fault-tolerance. We provide powerful new operations to simplify graph construction and transformation. Using these primitives we implement the PowerGraph and Pregel abstractions in less than 20 lines of code. Finally, by exploiting the Scala foundation of Spark, we enable users to interactively load, transform, and compute on massive graphs.

      Large-scale graph-structured computation is central to tasks ranging from targeted advertising to natural language processing and has led to the development of several graph-parallel abstractions including Pregel and GraphLab. However, the natural graphs commonly found in the real-world have highly skewed power-law degree distributions, which challenge the assumptions made by these abstractions, limiting performance and scalability.

      In this paper, we characterize the challenges of computation on natural graphs in the context of existing graphparallel abstractions. We then introduce the PowerGraph abstraction which exploits the internal structure of graph programs to address these challenges. Leveraging the PowerGraph abstraction we introduce a new approach to distributed graph placement and representation that exploits the structure of power-law graphs. We provide a detailed analysis and experimental evaluation comparing PowerGraph to two popular graph-parallel systems. Finally, we describe three different implementation strategies for PowerGraph and discuss their relative merits with empirical evaluations on large-scale real-world problems demonstrating order of magnitude gains.

In this paper, we extend the GraphLab framework to the substantially more challenging distributed setting while preserving strong data consistency guarantees. We develop graph based extensions to pipelined locking and data versioning to reduce network congestion and mitigate the effect of network latency. We also introduce fault tolerance to the GraphLab abstraction using the classic Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm and demonstrate how it can be easily implemented by exploiting the GraphLab abstraction itself. Finally, we evaluate our distributed implementation of the GraphLab abstraction on a large Amazon EC2 deployment and show 1-2 orders of magnitude performance gains over Hadoop-based implementations.}

      Latent variable techniques are pivotal in tasks ranging from predicting user click patterns and targeting ads to organizing the news and managing user generated content. Latent variable techniques like topic modeling, clustering, and subspace estimation provide substantial insight into the latent structure of complex data with little or no external guidance making them ideal for reasoning about large-scale, rapidly evolving datasets. Unfortunately, due to the data dependencies and global state introduced by latent variables and the iterative nature of latent variable inference, latent-variable techniques are often prohibitively expensive to apply to large-scale, streaming datasets.

      In this paper we present a scalable parallel framework for efficient inference in latent variable models over streaming web-scale data. Our framework addresses three key challenges: 1) synchronizing the global state which includes global latent variables (e.g., cluster centers and dictionaries); 2) efficiently storing and retrieving the large local state which includes the data-points and their corresponding latent variables (e.g., cluster membership); and 3) sequentially incorporating streaming data (e.g., the news). We address these challenges by introducing: 1) a novel delta-based aggregation system with a bandwidth-efficient communication protocol; 2) schedule-aware out-of-core storage; and 3) approximate forward sampling to rapidly incorporate new data. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our framework by easily tackling datasets two orders of magnitude larger than those addressed by the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we provide an optimized and easily customizable open-source implementation of the framework

Recent work in parallel Gibbs sampling has focused on update schedules which do not guarantee convergence to the intended stationary distribution. In this work, we propose two methods to construct parallel Gibbs samplers guaranteed to draw from the targeted distribution. The first method, called the Chromatic sampler, uses graph coloring to construct a direct parallelization of the classic sequential scan Gibbs sampler. In the case of 2-colorable models we relate the Chromatic sampler to the Synchronous Gibbs sampler (which draws all variables simultaneously in parallel), and reveal new ergodic properties of Synchronous Gibbs chains. Our second method, the Splash sampler, is a complementary strategy which can be used when the variables are tightly coupled. This constructs and samples multiple blocks in parallel, using a novel locking protocol and an iterative junction tree generation algorithm. We further improve the Splash sampler through adaptive tree construction. We demonstrate the benefits of our two sampling algorithms on large synthetic and real-world models using a 32 processor multi-core system.}

   abstract     = {As computer architectures move towards parallelism we must build a new theoretical understanding of parallelism in machine learning. In this paper we focus on parallelizing message passing inference algorithms in graphical models. We develop a theoretical understanding of the limitations of parallelism in belief propagation and bound the optimal achievable running parallel performance on a certain class of graphical models. We demonstrate that the fully synchronous parallelization of belief propagation is highly inefficient. We provide a new parallel belief propagation which achieves optimal performance on a certain class of graphical models. Using two challenging real-world problems, we empirically evaluate the performance of our algorithm. On the real-world problems, we find that our new algorithm achieves near linear performance improvements and out performs alternative parallel belief propagation algorithms.}

In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm, called FetchSGD, to overcome these challenges. FetchSGD compresses model updates using a Count Sketch, and then takes advantage of the mergeability of sketches to combine model updates from many workers. A key insight in the design of FetchSGD is that, because the Count Sketch is linear, momentum and error accumulation can both be carried out within the sketch. This allows the algorithm to move momentum and error accumulation from clients to the central aggregator, overcoming the challenges of sparse client participation while still achieving high compression rates and good convergence.

Prior works show meta-learning is a promising approach. But, fine-tuning techniques have drawn scant attention.

Such a simple approach outperforms the meta-learning methods by roughly 2\~20 points on current benchmarks and sometimes even doubles the accuracy of the prior methods. However, the high variance in the few samples often leads to the unreliability of existing benchmarks. We revise the evaluation protocols by sampling multiple groups of training examples to obtain stable comparisons and build new benchmarks based on three datasets: PASCAL VOC, COCO and LVIS.

We study the impact of model size in this setting, focusing on Transformer models for NLP tasks that are limited by compute: self-supervised pretraining and high-resource machine translation. We first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per iteration, wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps. Moreover, this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore, the most compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely large models but stop after a small number of iterations.

This leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models. However, we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques such as quantization and pruning than small models.

However, DARTS-based DNAS's search space is small when compared to other search methods', since all candidate network layers must be explicitly instantiated in memory. To address this bottleneck, we propose a memory and computationally efficient DNAS variant: DMaskingNAS. This algorithm expands the search space by up to $10^{14}\times$ over conventional DNAS, supporting searches over spatial and channel dimensions that are otherwise prohibitively expensive: input resolution and number of filters. We propose a masking mechanism for feature map reuse, so that memory and computational costs stay nearly constant as the search space expands. Furthermore, we employ effective shape propagation to maximize per-FLOP or per-parameter accuracy. The searched FBNetV2s yield state-of-the-art performance when compared with all previous architectures. With up to 421x less search cost, DMaskingNAS finds models with 0.9\% higher accuracy, 15\% fewer FLOPs than MobileNetV3-Small; and with similar accuracy but 20\% fewer FLOPs than Efficient-B0.

<div class="cards"><div id="Tanwani20_abs" class="collapse abstract"><div class="card card-body">Programming robots is complicated due to the lack of `plug-and-play' modules for skill acquisition. Virtualizing deployment of deep learning models can facilitate large-scale use/re-use of off-the-shelf functional behaviors. Deploying deep learning models on robots entails real-time, accurate and reliable inference service under varying query load. This letter introduces a novel Robot-Inference-and-Learning-as-a-Service (RILaaS) platform for low-latency and secure inference serving of deep models that can be deployed on robots. Unique features of RILaaS include: 1) low-latency and reliable serving with gRPC under dynamic loads by distributing queries over multiple servers on Edge and Cloud, 2) SSH based authentication coupled with SSL/TLS based encryption for security and privacy of the data, and 3) front-end REST API for sharing, monitoring and visualizing performance metrics of the available models. We report experiments to evaluate the RILaaS platform under varying loads of batch size, number of robots, and various model placement hosts on Cloud, Edge, and Fog for providing benchmark applications of object recognition and grasp planning as a service. We address the complexity of load balancing with a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes simulated profiles of networked robots; outperforming several baselines including round robin, least connections, and least model time with 68.30\% and 14.04\% decrease in round-trip latency time across models compared to the worst and the next best baseline respectively.

This paper gives a quick history of cloud computing, including an accounting of the predictions of the 2009 Berkeley View of Cloud Computing paper, explains the motivation for serverless computing, describes applications that stretch the current limits of serverless, and then lists obstacles and research opportunities required for serverless computing to fulfill its full potential. Just as the 2009 paper identified challenges for the cloud and predicted they would be addressed and that cloud use would accelerate, we predict these issues are solvable and that serverless computing will grow to dominate the future of cloud computing.</div></div><div id="Jonas2019_bib" class="collapse bibtex-entry"><div class="card card-body"><pre><code class="language-bib" data-lang="bib">

It provides an interface that greatly simplifies cloud programming, and represents an evolution that parallels the transition from assembly language to high-level programming languages. This paper gives a quick history of cloud computing, including an accounting of the predictions of the 2009 Berkeley View of Cloud Computing paper, explains the motivation for serverless computing, describes applications that stretch the current limits of serverless, and then lists obstacles and research opportunities required for serverless computing to fulfill its full potential. Just as the 2009 paper identified challenges for the cloud and predicted they would be addressed and that cloud use would accelerate, we predict these issues are solvable and that serverless computing will grow to dominate the future of cloud computing.},

Scaling video analytics to massive camera deployments, however, presents a new and mounting challenge, as compute cost grows proportionally to the number of camera feeds. This paper is driven by a simple question: can we scale video analytics in such a way that cost grows sublinearly, or even remains constant, as we deploy more cameras, while inference accuracy remains stable, or even improves. We believe the answer is yes. Our key observation is that video feeds from wide-area camera deployments demonstrate significant content correlations (e.g. to other geographically proximate feeds), both in space and over time. These spatio-temporal correlations can be harnessed to dramatically reduce the size of the inference search space, decreasing both workload and false positive rates in multi-camera video analytics. By discussing use-cases and technical challenges, we propose a roadmap for scaling video analytics to large camera networks, and outline a plan for its realization.</div></div><div id="Hotmobil2019_bib" class="collapse bibtex-entry"><div class="card card-body"><pre><code class="language-bib" data-lang="bib">

<div class="cards"><div id="sigmod13_abs" class="collapse abstract"><div class="card card-body">From social networks to targeted advertising, big graphs capture the structure in data and are central to recent advances in machine learning and data mining. Unfortunately, directly applying existing data-parallel tools to graph computation tasks can be cumbersome and inefficient. The need for intuitive, scalable tools for graph computation has lead to the development of new graph-parallel systems (e.g., Pregel, PowerGraph) which are designed to efficiently execute graph algorithms. Unfortunately, these new graph-parallel systems do not address the challenges of graph construction and transformation which are often just as problematic as the subsequent computation. Furthermore, existing graph-parallel systems provide limited fault-tolerance and support for interactive data mining.

We introduce GraphX, which combines the advantages of both data-parallel and graph-parallel systems by efficiently expressing graph computation within the Spark data-parallel framework. We leverage new ideas in distributed graph representation to efficiently distribute graphs as tabular data-structures. Similarly, we leverage advances in data-flow systems to exploit in-memory computation and fault-tolerance. We provide powerful new operations to simplify graph construction and transformation. Using these primitives we implement the PowerGraph and Pregel abstractions in less than 20 lines of code. Finally, by exploiting the Scala foundation of Spark, we enable users to interactively load, transform, and compute on massive graphs.</div></div><div id="sigmod13_bib" class="collapse bibtex-entry"><div class="card card-body"><pre><code class="language-bib" data-lang="bib">

Latent variable techniques like topic modeling, clustering, and subspace estimation provide substantial insight into the latent structure of complex data with little or no external guidance making them ideal for reasoning about large-scale, rapidly evolving datasets. Unfortunately, due to the data dependencies and global state introduced by latent variables and the iterative nature of latent variable inference, latent-variable techniques are often prohibitively expensive to apply to large-scale, streaming datasets.

In this paper we present a scalable parallel framework for efficient inference in latent variable models over streaming web-scale data. Our framework addresses three key challenges: 1) synchronizing the global state which includes global latent variables (e.g., cluster centers and dictionaries); 2) efficiently storing and retrieving the large local state which includes the data-points and their corresponding latent variables (e.g., cluster membership); and 3) sequentially incorporating streaming data (e.g., the news). We address these challenges by introducing: 1) a novel delta-based aggregation system with a bandwidth-efficient communication protocol; 2) schedule-aware out-of-core storage; and 3) approximate forward sampling to rapidly incorporate new data.

This document contains early descriptions of a course that is actively under development.
I am sharing this information to collect feedback and help students plan for future courses.
Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, these plans may change and so students who are interested in DS100 and would like more details should contact [me](index)!

# DS100: Principles & Techniques of Data Science

We are in the process of developing a new intermediate data science class, tentatively called DS100, that will cover the data science life-cycle spanning data acquisition, cleaning, exploration, summarization, hypothesis testing, and prediction.
Through this process we will explore some of the guiding principles in data management, visualization, statistics, and machine learning.
We will also learn some of the tools and techniques commonly used today.

## Goals

Students completing the course should be able to:

1. begin careers as a data scientist. **Employed**

1. use data and computational thinking to address problems in their lives and careers. **Empowered**

1. more easily master advanced Berkeley courses in data-management ([CS186](http://www.cs186berkeley.net)), machine learning ([CS189](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189/)), and statistics (Stat134). **Prepared**



## Prerequisites

While we are working to make this class widely accessible in the initial ([beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle)) version of the class we plan to require the following (or equivalent):

1. **(Strongly Encouraged)** *Foundations of Data Science* ([Data 8](http://data8.org/fa16/)).  This is an *excellent* class that covers much of the material in DS100 but at a higher level.  This class provides basic exposure to python programming and working with tabular data as well as visualization, statistics, and ML.

1. **(Math)** *Calculus and Linear Algebra* ([Math 54](https://math.berkeley.edu/~nadler/54fall2015.html) or [EE 16](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/fa16/)): We will need some basic concepts like linear operators, eigenvectors, derivatives, and integrals to enable statistical inference and derive new prediction algorithms.  Students with a strong mathematics background may be able to skip this prerequisite.

1. **(Computing)** *Algorithms and Data-Structures* ([CS61b](http://datastructur.es/sp16/)): Students will need a basic understanding of iteration, recursion, data-structures, and computational complexity.   However students with strong backgrounds in computing may be able to skip this prerequisite.


## Current (Very Tentative) Course Outline

{% assign counter = 1 %}

### Module 0: *Course Overview*

* **(Lecture {{ counter }}) {% assign counter = counter | plus: 1 %} *Course Overview*:** What is data science and how does this class relate to it?

* **(Lecture {{ counter }}) {% assign counter = counter | plus: 1 %} *The Data Science Lifecycle*:** What is the workflow of a data scientist and what should I have learned in DS8?

### Module 1: *Kinds of Data*

* **(Lecture {{ counter }}) {% assign counter = counter | plus: 1 %} *Working with Text and Semi-Structured Data*:** How do I transform textual and semi-structured data into easy to manipulate tabular representations?

* **(Lecture {{ counter }}) {% assign counter = counter | plus: 1 %} *Spatial and Temporal Data*:** How do I reconcile time and space across different datasets.


* **(Lecture {{ counter }}) {% assign counter = counter | plus: 1 %} *Multimedia Data*:** How do I extract and encode information from images, videos, and social networks?

* **(Lecture {{ counter }}) {% assign counter = counter | plus: 1 %} *Network Data*:** How do I reason about relationships between data?


### Module 2: *SQL and Data Management*

* **(Lecture {{ counter }}) {% assign counter = counter | plus: 1 %} *Introduction to SQL*:**
   What and why is SQL and how do I use it? (Basic queries)

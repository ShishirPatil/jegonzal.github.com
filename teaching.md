# [AI-Sys Graduate Seminar (294-159) Spring 2019](https://ucbrise.github.io/cs294-ai-sys-sp19/). 

[Course Website](https://ucbrise.github.io/cs294-ai-sys-sp19/)


### Description

The recent success of AI has been in large part due in part to advances in hardware and software systems. These systems have enabled training increasingly complex models on ever larger datasets. In the process, these systems have also simplified model development, enabling the rapid growth in the machine learning community. These new hardware and software systems include a new generation of GPUs and hardware accelerators (e.g., TPU and Nervana), open source frameworks such as Theano, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, Apache Spark, Clipper, Horovod, and Ray, and a myriad of systems deployed internally at companies just to name a few. At the same time, we are witnessing a flurry of ML/RL applications to improve hardware and system designs, job scheduling, program synthesis, and circuit layouts.

In this course, we will describe the latest trends in systems designs to better support the next generation of AI applications, and applications of AI to optimize the architecture and the performance of systems. The format of this course will be a mix of lectures, seminar-style discussions, and student presentations. Students will be responsible for paper readings, and completing a hands-on project. Readings will be selected from recent conference proceedings and journals. For projects, we will strongly encourage teams that contains both AI and systems students.

## Previous Graduate Seminars

When time is available I teach graduate seminars in machine learning and systems.  


1.  [CS294-20: RISE Lab Class](https://ucbrise.github.io/cs294-rise-fa16) a graduate seminar covering the research topics in the new UC Berkeley RISE Lab.  This class was co-taught with Joe Hellerstein, Raluca Ada Popa, and Ion Stoica.

   > This seminar aims to serve as a catalyst for research in the RISE lab, the new lab following the AMPLab. We will read and discuss papers on the state-of-the-art of learning systems (large-scale model training, deep learning, real-time robust inference), big data systems (scale-out vs scale-up, scalable data analytics), and systems security (computation on encrypted data, secure hardware enclaves, language-based mechanisms).

# Data Science 100

I co-created this large intermediate data science class. This class now serves over 800 students a semester.

Combining data, computation, and inferential thinking, data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand their world. This intermediate level class bridges between Data8 and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making.â€‹ Through a strong emphasizes on data centric computing, quantitative critical thinking, and exploratory data analysis this class covers key principles and techniques of data science. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing.

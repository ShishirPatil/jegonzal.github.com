I am currently co-teaching <a href="https://ucbrise.github.io/cs294-rise-fa16/syllabus">CS294-20: RISE Lab Class</a> a graduate seminar covering the research topics in the new UC Berkeley RISE Lab.  This class is being co-taught with Joe Hellerstein, Raluca Ada Popa, and Ion Stoica.

I am also in the process of planning a new intermediate data-science class ([DS100](DS100)) to be taught in Spring 2017.
If you are interested in Data Science and would like to help in building this new class please let me know!


Previously I taught <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cs186spring2016/">Introduction to Databases (CS186/286)</a> with Joe Hellerstein.

I am an assistant professor in the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu">EECS department</a> at UC Berkeley and a founding member of the new UC Berkeley [RISE Lab](http://rise.cs.berkeley.edu).  My [research interests](research) are at the intersection of machine learning and data systems and my students are working on a wide range of projects including:


* real-time model serving 
* dynamic deep neural networks for transfer learning
* accelerated deep learning for high-resolution computer vision
* new cryptographic primitives for federated learning
* frameworks for deep reinforcement learning and parameter tuning
* explainable reinforcement learning
* software platforms for autonomous vehicles

<b>Co-founder:</b> I am also co-founder of <a href="http://Turi.com">Turi Inc.</a> (formerly GraphLab), which was based on my work on the <a href="https://github.com/dato-code/PowerGraph">GraphLab and PowerGraph Systems</a>.  Turi was recently <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2016/exclusive-apple-acquires-turi-major-exit-seattle-based-machine-learning-ai-startup/">acquired</a> by Apple Inc.


<b>Background:</b> Before joining UC Berkeley as a professor,  I was a post-doc in the  <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu">AMPLab</a> working on several projects including <a href="http://spark.apache.org/graphx/">GraphX</a> (now part of <a href="http://spark.apache.org">Apache Spark</a>), early versions of <a href="http://mlbase.org">MLbase</a>, <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/velox/">Velox</a>, and <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/ccml/">concurrency control for ML</a>.

## COVID-19 News 

I recently released a special edition of the [Data Engineering Bulletin](http://sites.computer.org/debull/A20june/issue1.htm).  We also have a [blog post](https://medium.com/@covista/governments-vs-big-tech-resolving-differences-in-contact-tracing-b3d39193bfe4) about advances and issues in digital contact tracing.

## Prospective Postdocs and Graduate Students

I am currently looking for postdocs and graduate students to join the new <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley RISE Lab</a>.  As a founding member of the RISE Lab, I am working on several projects in large-scale systems for real-time machine learning, deep neural network design for accelerated computer vision, dynamic networks for multi-task learning, sparse representations for autonomous vehicles, software architectures for robotic systems, and explainable reinforcement learning.
My machine learning research spans both classical statistical machine learning methods as well as new work in deep learning.  If you are interested please consider applying to the UC Berkeley CS <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/research-programs/admissions">graduate program</a> in <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/DBMS/">DBMS</a> or <a href ="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/AI/">AI</a>.  
If you are looking for a post-doc position please contact me directly.


## Research Opportunities for Undergraduate Students

We are also looking for motivated undergraduate students who would like to get involved in doing cutting edge research.  If you are an undergraduate at Berkeley and are interested in getting involved in research please fill out [DARE Application](https://dare.berkeley.edu/).

### Entrepreneurship 

I am currently a technical advisor for [AnyScale.ai](http://anyscale.ai) which is developing a platform for distributed computing in Python.  [AnyScale.ai](http://anyscale.ai) is currently hiring!

## Funding

My research as part of the UC Berkeley RISE Lab is funded by the NSF Expedition grant and a consortium of industrial sponsors:
